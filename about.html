            Drainage Districts have played an important part in the development of Illinios- both agriculturally and economically. Through their formation and operation, fertile wetlands and major flood plains of the State have been developed into Prime Agricultural Land. Continued operation and improvement of these drainage districts will allow this progress to continue. 
            Under the Illinois Drainage Code drainage districts may be formed to construct, maintain or repair drains or levees to or engage in other drainage of levee work. The area included within a district is not required to conform to any pre-existing political boundaries and may cover more than one county. 
            <br><br>

            The concept of drainage district formation for mutual benefit is based on a system of assessments which permits districts to include only lands benefited by organization of a drainage district. Thus a person’s land may not be included, against his will, in a drainage district and hence become liable for assessments unless it can be shown that his property will be materially benefitted by the inclusion.  
            A drainage district may be organized by filing a petition in the county court signed by a majority of the landowners who own on-third of the land within the proposed district, or by one-thrid of the landowners who own a majority of all land in the proposed district. 
            An alternate method of organiizatio nis provided for in the Drainage Code. Under the alternate method, a smaller number of landowners may petition for organization. The petition must be signed by at least one-tenth of the adulst owners who own at least one-firfth of the land. A referendum must subsequently be held and passed by a majority of the landowners within the proposed district boundaries. 
            <br><br>
            Drainage districts in Illinois have been organized for a variety of specific functions under the Drainage Code. The specifi reason for formation must be included in the organizational title. Thus, there are outlet districts, mutual districts, levee districts, levee and drainage districts, and various combinations of the above. 
            <br>            <br><br>

            A drainage district has three commissioners who serve staggered terms. Generally speaking, the commissioners have the power, authroizty and duty to do all things necessary for the accomplishment of the purpose designated by law. Their powers and duties, specifically prescribed and strictly construed by the Drainage Code, are as follows: 
            <br>
            a.	To go upon the lnad, employ necessary assistance, and adopt a plan or system of drainage.
            <br>
            b.	To obtain the necessary lands and rights of way be agreement or, if necessary, by eminent domain proceedings. 
            <br>
            c.	In the corporate name of the district to enter into contracts sue or to be sued, plead and be impleaded, and do all such acts and things as may be necessary for the accomplishment of the purposed of this act:
            <br>
            d.	To comproise suits and controversies and employ necessary agents and attorneys:
            <br>e.	To carry out specific provisions of the law relative to making various types of assessments, employing a treasurer, employing other assistance, annexing lands, borrowing funds, enforcing payment of assessments, and consolidating and dissolving district. 
            <br>f.	To let contracts for the surveying, laying, constructing, repairing, altering, enlarging, cleaning, protecting, and maintaining of any drain, ditch, levee, or other work; to let contracts by bid if the work to be done is the construction of the principal work and the cost is more than $1,000. 
            <br>g.	To borrow money, without court authority, up to 90 percent of assessments unpaid at the time for the payment of any authorized debts or construction; 
            <br>h.	To widen, straighten, deepen, or enlarge any ditch or watercourse, and to remove driftwood and rubbish whether the ditch is in, outside of, or below the district. 
            <br>i.	To cause railroad companies to construct, rebuild or enlarge bridges or culverts when necessary. 
            <br>j.	To make annual or more frequent reports as required by the circuit cour, including an annual financial report. 
            <br>k.	To conduct meetings in the county or counties in which the district is located; 
            <br>l.	To use public highways for the purposes of work to be done;
            <br>m.	To keep the works of the district in operation and repair;
            <br>n.	To seel or lease any land owned by the district; 
            <br>o.	To own and operate necessary machinery and equipment;
            <br>p.	To construct access roads and level spoil banks;
            <br>q.	To abandon works no longer useful to the district, and
            <br>r.	To construct with other public agencies, including the federal government. 
            <br><br>

            <br>The court may, for good cause, remove any commissioner appointed by it and may fill all vacancies. Also, the law provides for a penalty and removal from office of a commissioner who refuses or neglects to discharge the duties imposed on him by law.
            <br><br>
            Also, upon petition to the court, either by the ocmmiserr or a landowner, the court may determine the duty of the commissioners toward such landowner. 
            <br><br>
            
            The Drainage Code also includes provisions for abandoning work and dissolving districts, consolidating districts, annexing and detaching lands, and organizing subdistricts.  <br><br>
            
            The methodology used in compling the preliminary report was not without its weaknesses. Problems were encourntered in the compliation and reporting of the data, and the data for some of the drainage districts Is missing. The following paragraphs explain more clearly the problems encountered and reasons for omissions. <br><br>
            
            One of the problems encountered was determining the actual name of each drainage district. One district may be listed by two or three different names in the same number of sources consulted. In these cases, the name most generally used in the report is that name listed in the county records. <br><br>
            
            In other instances, certain drainage districts with similar, yet differently spelled names, or perhaps even completely different names appeared to occupy the same land boundaries. When, through comparison of organization dates, size and location, etc., these districts were adjudged to be, in fact, the same legal organization reported under different names, they were recorded as only one drainage district. <br><br>
            
            IN some cases, one drainage district may be known by two entirely different names. This is generally reflective of a condition whereby the district was officially organized under one name but is referred to by a different name in local common usage. IN these instances, an effort has been made to include both the officially designated name and the more commonly used name. <br><br>
            
            In certain cases, a district may have legally changed its name some time during its history. Where this fact has been ascertained, it was so recorded in the data. <br><br>
            
            There are many drainage projects or mutual drainage agreements throughout the State of Illinois which may not have been noted in this report, due to their small size and/or the lack of concrete knowledge thereof. These projects or agreements have in all likelihood been organized outside court jurisdiction or specific law of the state of Illinois. <br><br>
            
            Other districts reported here may have been organized in the same fashion, but their larger size or continuing known drainage activity has warranted their inclusion in this report. Usually in such cases, knowledge fo the drainage district’s name is noted, and its lack of legal organization is also noted. <br><br>
            
            Still other drainage projects may have originally organized in this out-of-court fashion and subsequently turned to the county court to establish legal entity. Where this is known to have taken place, the fact is noted. <br><br>
            
            IN many of the sources consulted, mention is made of drainage districts which may have been in the process of organizing at the time of publication of that particular report, or which may have been reported as duly organized but which subsequently have never constructed improvements or levied assessments. IN other isntances, a petition to organize was found in the county files, but further research revealed the original petition to organize had been denied by the court. Many districts such as these which may or may not have actually attained legal status are  reported in ordert to note their doubtful status. <br><br>
            
            There are several counties in the report which are listed as having no legally organized drainage districts within their boundaries. Such determination was made after review of all information available, including the sources listed in the bibliography, county records, and from conversation with local farmers and Soil Conseervation Service Officials. This does not, however, rule out the possibility that small mutual drainage projects or unofficial agreements between two or more individual landowners may be actively functioning within these counties. <br><br>
            
            Some explanation regarding the method of reporting drainage sub-districts should be given. Records are generally available on those with definite legal organization and continuing activities. Others may have failed to organize for some reason, or may have been inactive for many years. A hypothetical case, a situation may arise in which a “Subdistrict Number 7” may be the only such subdistrict reported within a main district. An accompanying note will indicate  what other subdistricts may have been organized, but no record or mention of them has been discovered. <br><br>
            
            Organization dates, where possible, are those found in the actual court records of the counties. Where this was not possible because of incomplete court records, the organization dates given are those taken from other sources and may not necessarily be of the same accuracy as those taken directly from court records. <br><br>
            
            In some cases, no date of organization  from any source was available. This resulted when court records had been misplaced or were destroyed by fire, or when a drainage district had originally been organized outside court jurisdiction. <br><br>
            
            In other cases, a drainage district may actually have more than one organization date due to subsequent reorganizations under court jurisdiction. Where the actual operating organization and district boundary have not been significantly altered by reorganization, only the earliest date of organization is shown. <br><br>
            
            Unless otherwise designated, all acreage figures given represent the district acreage on which assessments are, or have been, levied. In some cases, this assessed acreage data is taken directly from an assessment roll recently filed with the court. When a district has not assessed for several years and an assessment rol is not available, the acreages given are those derived from other sources. Because There was sometimes a great disparity between the acreage figures given in various reference sources, the acreage figure  used was from that source whose other data corresponded most closely with the actual record data. <br><br>
            
            Determining the present status of a drainage district was another factor of some debate. At first it was thought the key to determining a district’s status lay in its assessing practices. Because construction and operations of drainage ditches and systems is a continuing process usually requiring some form of periodic maintenance, and because assessments provide the financial resources necessary for such construction and maintenance, it was felt that an assessment levied in 1960 or subsequently would indicate district activity. After consideration, it was concluded this was not an adequate basis for determining the question for status. In the past, it has not been uncommon to find a drainage district levying assessments only once every fifteen or twenty years but making the assessment payable in ten or fifteen equal annual installments. Thus, the court records may show no certificate in levy since 1959 when, in actuality, the district is still collecting on an assessment levied some fifteen years ago. Also, though a district may no longer be assessing, it may be filing a very active role as a local sponsor for an SCS or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers project. <br><br>
            
            Thus, it was decided to base the status determination of a drainage district upon its actual entries in court records from 1960 to the present. Any entry such as a commissioner election or appointment, an annual report being filed, or a treasurer’s bond being sold, indicated some degree of activity on the part of the district. Such districts are reported as being active. Those districts with no court entries since 1959 are classified as inactive. If a district has been legally dissolved by court order, that fact is noted, and where possible, the date of dissolution is given. <br><br>
            
            Some drainage districts have no definite status indicated in the data sheets. This has been caused by several factors. Drainage districts may have been absorbed into another district without having been legally dissolved. In a case such as this, a note explaining the situation will accompany the district data. In other cases, concrete evidence as to the degree of activity or inactivity of subdistricts may be missing; but due to the activity of the main district, or mention made of the subdistrict in the main district annual report, it was difficult to classify the subdistrict as either active, inactive, or dissolved. IN these cases, the status is left as undetermined. <br><br>
            
            Occasionally drainage districts have been listed by other sources as dissolved or consolidated with others to form one drainage district when this, in legal fact, is not the case. In cooperating with state or federal agencies these districts may have acted, purely for convenience, as a consolidated single unit. This situation often arises where tow or more districts may share the same levee works or drainage outlets, but actively maintain separate legal organizations, access individually, and elect or have the court appoint their individual officers. In cases such as these, the districts are listed as separate districts. <br><br>
            
            An attempt has been made to provide a map or short description of location for every organized Drainage District in the State. Also, county maps with identifying indices are included to further provide location information. Within the inventory listing appears a column heading entitled “Map/Location.” This column lists a page number or a page-item number (example 810-14). The first number refers to that age in the report on which a map or location description can be found. The second number refers to that item on the page which gives the location description. The maps are somewhat dated, and they are not intended to reflect the exact present boundaries of the district. Instead they provide a general idea of district shape and location. In those cases where maps are not available, effort has been made to indicate the general area within which the drainage district lies. <br><br>
            
            For some drainage districts no number will appear in the “Map/Location” column. Generally, this indicates either that the district is of too recent of an origin to have maps available, or the district is so old and inactive that a map or location description was impossible to find. Also, in several instances, maps located in court records have not been used because their age and condition would not permit making reproductions. <br><br>
            
            Finally, it will be noted there are some drainage districts included in the report for which no record Is available. Nothing could be found for these districts other than their names. They may have been mentioned casually in other publications or may have been mentioned in the annual report of another drainage district. It is felt the listing of such district names at least demonstrates some awareness of their possible existence. <br><br>
            
            
            This report is presented in the hopes that it serves as a useful tool in the futher investigation of Illinois Drainage district organization and activity. <br><br>
